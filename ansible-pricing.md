## Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed Trial plan
{: #lite-plan}

The Trial plan is a 90 day, no-cost trial of the capabilities that are available in the Essentials plan, with no resource limits. The plan includes task prompt capabilities and a preset limit of code tokens. The plan does not include the tuning capability, which is available only in the Standard plan. To use the Trial plan, see [Activate Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/interactive-walkthrough/install-ansible-lightspeed){: external}.

## Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed Essentials plan
{: #essentials-plan}

The Essentials plan is a pay-as-you-go plan with no preset limit that includes task prompt capabilities. With this plan, you can create task prompts from natural language requests to generate Ansible code. The plan does not include the tuning capability, which is available only in the Standard plan.

## Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed Standard plan
{: #standard-plan}

The Standard plan is a prepaid monthly plan that includes both task prompt and model tuning capabilities. With this plan, you can create task prompts from natural language requests to generate Ansible code. You can also tune the IBM base code model on your own data so that it generates code suggestions that are customized for your enterprise standards.

The Standard plan isn't available in the Sydney (`au-syd`) data center. You need to choose either the Dallas (`us-south`) or Frankfurt (`eu-de`) data centers.
